# Finance Calculator
A Python program which allows the user to access two different financial calculators: **an investment calculator** and a **home loan repayment calculator**.

The investment calculator calculates the amount of interest the user will earn on their investment. The user can specify either simple or compound interest. The home loan repayment calculator calculates the amount the user will have to pay on a home loan, on a monthly basis.
